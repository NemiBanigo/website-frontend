			<h2 class="training-program"> A training program for European emerging musicians based on entrepreneurial strategy </h2>
				<p class= "musician"> A musician can hardly rely on music sales and touring to earn a living. Working as a musician today is the need to diversify revenue 	 streams.

			European Music Incubator is an innovative training program for European emerging musicians who want to develop a long-term career grounded on entrepreneurial mindset and beyond the traditional framework of popular music.

			The program is considering the diversification of activities as a key-factor to diversify revenue streams and to reach a wider audience.</p>
